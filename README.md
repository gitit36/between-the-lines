*** Web application to render more transparent and approachable privacy policies. Functionalities include privacy policy summarization, similarity analysis, readability score, and topic modeling. ***

### Problem
Privacy policies are filled with jargon and are not made for the average user.
> 65% of personal data will be covered under a privacy regulation by 2023 (Gartner Inc.)

Users have lost control over how their data is collected and where their data is stored.
> 79% of respondents are concerned about how companies are using their personal data (Pew Research)



In a nutshell, a user can type in the url/name of the website in order to analyse the privacy policies.

To run this program, go to the designated directory and type in your terminal:

```
python ppds.py
```
